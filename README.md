# SciNet Vault

## Overview

**SciNet Vault** is the world’s first blockchain-powered scientific reproducibility platform, designed to ensure research data and results are immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof. By leveraging Binance’s BNB Greenfield for decentralized file storage and integrating AI-driven reproducibility scoring, SciNet Vault aims to restore trust in scientific research by drastically reducing bias, incentivizing peer review, and rewarding validated contributions with its native platform token, **Svi**.

---

## Why SciNet Vault?

- **Reproducibility Crisis:** Around 70% of scientific research published worldwide is not reproducible, resulting in an estimated wastage of $28 billion annually. The inability to reproduce results undermines trust in science and reality itself.
- **The Solution:** SciNet Vault brings blockchain security, decentralized peer review, and AI scoring to scientific publishing, making research validation transparent, reliable, and rewarding.

## Key Features

- **BNB Greenfield Storage:** All research files (datasets, code, supplementary materials) are stored on BNB Greenfield, ensuring decentralized, tamper-proof, and accessible file management.
- **Immutable Records:** Every submission and review is recorded on-chain, guaranteeing data integrity and preventing manipulation.
- **AI-Powered Reproducibility Scoring:** Advanced algorithms assess the reproducibility of research data, providing reliability scores for each submission.
- **Decentralized Peer Review:** Incentivized peer reviewers validate scientific findings, reducing bias and increasing transparency in the publication process.
- **Svi Platform Token:** Contributors, reviewers, and validators are rewarded with Svi tokens, creating a robust economy around scientific validation and reproducibility.
- **Scalability:** The platform is tested for high-volume submissions and is production-ready.
- **Transparent Incentives:** Researchers are rewarded for reproducible work, and reviewers for thorough validation, aligning incentives for quality science.

## Architecture

**Main Components:**
- **Frontend:** User dashboard for submissions, reproducibility assessments, peer review, and token management.
- **Backend:** Handles submission logic, AI scoring, peer review workflows, and blockchain integration.
- **BNB Greenfield Integration:** Manages decentralized file storage and retrieval.
- **Smart Contracts:** For immutable recording of submissions, reviews, and token transactions.
- **Svi Token:** ERC-20/BEP-20 token smart contract powering the incentive system.

**Data Flow:**
1. **Submission:** Researcher uploads files (datasets, code, etc.) via web interface.
2. **Storage:** Files are stored on BNB Greenfield; metadata and hash are recorded on-chain.
3. **AI Scoring:** Automated reproducibility scoring is triggered.
4. **Peer Review:** Reviewers are incentivized to validate research and provide feedback.
5. **Token Rewards:** Svi tokens are distributed for validated contributions and peer reviews.
